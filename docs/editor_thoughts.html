</h1>
            <time>Posted on 2020.7.29

            <hr>
            <p>After using vim for a few years and trying some non-modal editors recently, I
decided to write my own editor. There are a couple of reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing an editor seems like a cool project</li>
<li>No editor currently does movement in the way I want, and adapting current
editors would be a pain</li>
<li>Every editor I've tried is too far on one end of the complexity spectrum</li>
<li>I want to experiment with combining a simpler editor with other software to
create a development environment</li>
<li>I'm tired of using a weird language for plugins and configuration (vimscript)</li>
</ul>

<h1>editor movement</h1>

<p>The editors I've used all use a concept of words for navigation, which is not
conducive to navigating code. For example, each <code>|</code> shows a &quot;word&quot; boundary
according to vim:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fff">|printf|(&#34;%|s|\|n|&#34;, |my_string|);
</pre>
<p>The logic for what defines a word seems to be all over the place, and ideally
I want something more like this, where there is a word boundary at the end of
each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Token">token</a>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#fff">|printf|(|&#34;|%s|\n|&#34;|,| |my_string|)|;|
</pre>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <code>%s</code> and <code>\n</code> are both recognized as individual tokens here.</p>

<h1>complexity/simplicity/scope</h1>

<p>I find vim to be too large in scope to fully grasp, without dedicating more time
to learning it than I deem reasonable. Given the number of operations I use on a
day-to-day basis I don't think modal editing is neccesary either.</p>

<p>I intend to only have a few keybindings in my editor, mostly based around
movement:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Keybind</th>
<th>Function</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Ctrl-S</td>
<td>Save</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Ctrl-Shift-S</td>
<td>Save as</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>PgUp/PgDown</td>
<td>Page up/Down</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Home/End</td>
<td>Start/end of line</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Ctrl-Home/End</td>
<td>Select whole line and put cursor at start/end of line</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Arrows</td>
<td>Move one cell in a direction</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Ctrl-Left/Right Arrow</td>
<td>Move one token left/right</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Shift-Movement</td>
<td>Extend or start selection</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Ctrl-F</td>
<td>Find and replace (including regex)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Ctrl-M</td>
<td>Run or record macro</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Ctrl-[, Ctrl-]</td>
<td>Fold/Unfold block</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>One important thing to note here is that on both keyboards I use (laptop and a
60% w/arrow keys), the arrow keys are right below enter and are much closer to
the home row than on typical keyboards. It might make sense to consider
alternate bindings or a modal editor for keyboards that have the arrow keys
positioned somewhere more inconvenient.</p>

<h1>software composition</h1>

<p>Previously, vim was my entire development environment: file manager, editor,
terminal multiplexer, build system binds, etc. Now, instead of having everything
inside my editor, I want to have everything loosely coupled together with a
standalone terminal multiplexer such as dvtm or tmux.</p>

<p><img src="images/editor_ide.png" alt="IDE Example" />
<img src="images/editor_tmux.png" alt="Tmux, CFM, vim and a terminal" /></p>

<p>Ideally I have the terminal multiplexer manage keybinds, and link everything
together. This way if I decide I'm no longer a fan of my editor, then switching
a new editor into my development environment should be easy, while still
maintaining the same general workflow.</p>

<h1>plugins w/ffi</h1>

<p>Instead of having to directly edit the editors source or using something like
vimscript, I want to load shared objects as plugins at runtime. This gives me
the option of using any number of languages such as rust, go, or c/c++ for
writing plugins.</p>

<h1>recap</h1>

<p>My main goal is to make an editor that hits the perfect balance between
complexity and simplicity for myself. Things are likely to change from what I've
written here as I progress through development.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I will likely not start work on this for a while (~3 months)
due to already having a fairly large project underway.</p>
